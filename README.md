### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The project about equalizer in MATLAB
An equalizer is tried to be designed via MATLAB. The equalizer filters the signal 
according to the given specifications. The filtration process of the equalizer is conducted by 
FIR bandpass, lowpass and highpass filters. The equalizer amplifies and compresses 
amplitudes of different frequency components in compliance with the userâ€™s choice. 
There is a user interface and there are 4 prepared options (Pop, Rock, Bass and 
Classical).
